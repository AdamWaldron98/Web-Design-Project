				English is one of the most spoken languages on the planet and a lot of people believe it to be an essential skill to have in life. Here you can gain a better understanding of english and its uses!
				<br><br>
				In english, words are put into seperate catagories like nouns and verbs. Nouns are words that are the names of places, people or things. A proper noun is a word that uses a capital letter at the start of the word. For example, Adam, France.
				<br><br>
				Verbs are action words like run or walk. They are used to describe an action. When verbs and nouns are put together, they form a sentence. For example, Adam walks home every day.
