				The capital of Kenya is Nairobi. Kenya is made up of low areas that rise into highlands. Kenya borders with several other countries such as Ethiopia, Somalia and Uganda. The climate in Kenya varies all over the county, ranging from cool every day to always hot and sunny. This depends on how far away from the sea the location is.
